BOMWeather
----------


Weather from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology

This utility will use the freely supplied weather forecast data as provided by the bureau.
At these stages it looks as though multiple format types will be parsed. 
	XML for convenience sake
	Hash separated text files because there isn't anything better
	
Every property that the bureau measures isn't going to be implemented in this wrapper.
If you want additional properties, perhaps fork the git project and send them my way.
(I'm not being lazy, I have no requirement for evaporation or temperature from 50cm off the ground!)
