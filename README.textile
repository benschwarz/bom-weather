h2. Usage

To get the weather forecast, there are a few options:

# Getting a location by name
<pre><code>BOMWeather::Location.find({ :location => "NAME" })</code></pre>
# Getting a location by BOM location id
<pre><code>BOMWeather::Location.find({ :loc_id => "ID" })</code></pre>
# Getting a whole state's weather forecasts
<pre><code>BOMWeather::Location.find({ :state => "STATE" })</code></pre>
This takes state's in abbreviated form (e.g. WA, NSW, VIC)
