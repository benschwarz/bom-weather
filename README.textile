h2. Usage

To get the weather forecast, there are a few options:

<ol>
<li>Getting a location by name
<pre><code>BOMWeather::Location.find({ :location => "NAME" })</code></pre></li>
<li>Getting a location by BOM location id
<pre><code>BOMWeather::Location.find({ :loc_id => "ID" })</code></pre></li>
<li>Getting a whole state's weather forecasts<br />
<pre><code>BOMWeather::Location.find({ :state => "STATE" })</code></pre><br />
This takes state's in abbreviated form (e.g. WA, NSW, VIC)</li>
</ol>

Provided this finds a location (or locations), you will get an array of Location objects.

You can then get access to the forecast information:

<pre><code>loc = BOMWeather::Location.find({ :location => "NAME" })
loc.first.outlook</code></pre>

This returns an array of Forecast objects, each of which have the following accessible methods
# max_temp
# min_temp
# conditions
# forecast_date (a Time object)
# issue_time
